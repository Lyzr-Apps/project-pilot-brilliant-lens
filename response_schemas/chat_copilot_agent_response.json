Research authentication methods (password, OAuth, biometrics, etc.) and select the one that fits your project best.\n2. Set up user data storage (e.g., a database for user credentials).\n3. Design the registration process (input validation, storing credentials securely).\n4. Implement the login process (checking credentials, handling errors).\n5. Set up session management (using cookies, tokens, or sessions).\n6. Add security measures (password hashing, SSL, brute-force protection).\n7. Test authentication workflows for edge cases and vulnerabilities.\n\nWould you like these as individual tasks in your plan? If so, I can add them for you!",
